# doppler-module-4-challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build a blog web application. It featured writing code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's purpose was to utilize Javascript to affect the HTML and CSS based on user input conditions.  The needed functionality included a light/dark mode, as well as utilizing Local Storage to store variables.

## Description
This blog allows users to author blog posts containing content and a title. It includes a light/dark mode function that depends upon Local Storage to save the user's preferred mode and changes CSS styling variables as the user toggles the button. It also is dynamic in that the blog website grows as a user submits more posts. It has a flexbox layout in the CSS styling.
